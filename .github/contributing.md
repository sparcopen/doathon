# How to Get Involved

<h2>What is a do-a-thon?</h2>
<p>Building off the concept of a hackathon, a do-a-thon is a work-sprint where people from different skill sets work together and collaborate on different challenges and projects. For OpenCon's do-a-thon, we’ll be focusing on building projects and solutions that seek to advance Open Access, Open Education, and Open Data. </p>
<p>Our do-a-thon has three key goals:</p>

<h3>1. Focus on <i>doing</i>, rather than just <i>hacking.</i></h3>
<p> The do-a-thon's focus is on <i>action</i> - today, we want to get stuff done! What we want to emphasize is that you don't need to be a coder or a designer or someone who is familiar with tech to participate, design solutions, and take action (although those skills are of course welcome!). Solutions to problems facing the Open Research and Open Education communities are not necessarily technical in nature, and can include campaigns, strategy development, policy changes, resource creation, educating, media-based organizing, and more! We are encouraging you to get creative with the approaches you take to create a more open and accessible system for sharing the world's information.</p>

<h3>2. Explore problems deeply and thoughtfully.</h3>
<p>We're asking participants to <i>really</i> understand what the hurdles are in an issue—before jumping straight to a solution. What kinds of <u>challenges</u> are you trying to address? Defining and dissecting the problem helps avoid the situation of designing a solution that doesn't actually address the heart of an issue. So, we're equipping you with a toolkit of design thinking methods that will encourage you to better understand the systems Open Research and Open Education are being built in — as well as the people involved, and the people these problems affect.</p>

<h3>3. Encourage collaboration across skillsets.  Build solutions together. </h3><a name="how"></a>
<p>Amazing things can happen when people with a wide variety of skills, expertise, and personal experience come together. We want policy makers to talk to educators, librarians to work with web developers, designers to collaborate with researchers, and everything in between. We're excited to see what happens when folks across disciplines and regions pool together their knowledge to imagine something big.</p>

<h2>How does it work? How can I participate?</h2>
<p>The official do-a-thon date is November 13, 2017, but we're encouraging folks to get started before — and hopefully, carry on projects and collaboration after. Here are a few ways you can get involved and participate:</p>

<h3>1. Anyone can propose a problem to work on.</h3>
<p>Is there a specific issue or problem you want to tackle in Open Research and Education? Here's a chance to share it with the OpenCon Community and work together on designing a solution. We'll provide you with a host of design thinking resources to make your process more efficient. Participants can submit challenges the day of the do-a-thon, but we'd love if folks could submit big questions they want to tackle in advance, too.  Find out more about how to submit a challenge <u><a href="/challenge">here.</a></u></p>

<h3>2. Anyone can propose a project for others to collaborate on and contribute to.</h3>
<p>Have a project idea you want to put into action? Or an existing project that needs development or support? The do-a-thon is a great opportunity to receive support and contributions from collaborators around the world. Learn more about how to propose and lead a project <u><a href="project">here.</a></u></p>

<h3>3. Anyone can contribute their skills and ideas to existing challenges and projects. </h3>
<p>Participate from wherever you are by contributing to one or more of the do-a-thon projects and challenges submitted. We expect that most of the action will take place on November 13th, but feel free to get in touch with project leads and see how you can help out beforehand! You can explore the growing list of projects and challenges we're working on <u><a href="/participate">here</a></u>.</p>
